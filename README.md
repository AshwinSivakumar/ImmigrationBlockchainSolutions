Abstract: Innovations in digital identity verification, especially in the field of immigration and border security is in high demand in terms of expansion of data storage and rising security concerns. There is also a rising emphasis for stateless persons such as refugees and political asylum seekers gaining digital identity without the threat of tampering or misuse by any state or non-state actors. In this paper we propose the adoption of blockchain mechanisms in the system of immigration, particularly in the usage and verification of passports. These applications are not only limited to passport acquisition and verification. We intend to extend the scope to passport renewal, unique passport-visa linkage, faster process in order to retrieve new passport in case of loss of passport as well as passport cancellation, visa cancellation and state of refugee identity.
